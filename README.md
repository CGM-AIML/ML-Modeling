## Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Machine Learning** course in the **UT Austin / Great Learning Post Graduate Program in AI & ML (2025–2026)**.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline on the **AllLife Bank dataset**, predicting personal loan acceptance by applying data preparation, feature engineering, model training, tuning, and evaluation.  

## Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)  
- Hyperparameter tuning and pruning for optimization
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, confusion matrices, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter / Google Colab  

## Key Insights
- Logistic regression serves as a strong baseline for binary classification.  
- Decision trees and random forests improved performance but required careful tuning to reduce overfitting.  
- Balanced accuracy and ROC-AUC provided more reliable measures than raw accuracy for imbalanced data.
- Over-pruning led to high recall but excessive false positives, highlighting the importance of balance in model tuning.
